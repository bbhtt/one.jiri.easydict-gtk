    <p>
      The first open source translator which is completely open with dictionary data too. The homepage is http://easydict.jiri.one. On this page you can also try the search results, which will be the same as in the app (however, the web application does not use TinyDB+orjson as a backend, but uses RethinkDB - the source data is the same). The application is at an early stage of development, but the features and dictionaries that have already been implemented work very well.
